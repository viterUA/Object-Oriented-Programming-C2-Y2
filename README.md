# Object Oriented Programming C2 Year 2

## Overview

This repository contains coursework and assessment materials for the *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* class, Course Code C2, Year 2. It includes Java-based assignments, documentation, and design artefacts to demonstrate principles of object orientation (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction).

## Features & Objectives

* **Design and implement** object‐oriented solutions in Java.
* **Document** design decisions, software architecture, class diagrams, interfaces.
* **Assess** code structure for maintainability, modularity, reusability.
* Implement Java projects that showcase:

  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
  * Abstraction
  * Proper exception handling and input validation

## How to Use / Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viterUA/Object-Oriented-Programming-C2-Y2.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).

3. Explore the `assessment/` folder to find the assignment details.

4. Build & run the Java code. If applicable, follow instructions in the documentation files for setup.

## Contribution & Development

* This is primarily a student coursework repository; contributions might include improving documentation, refactoring code, adding tests.
* If sharing publicly, clean up IDE-specific files (e.g. `.idea/`), and ensure documentation is complete.
